# iTunesMediaApp
iTunesMediaApp is an App that displays two lists of media type: (1) Audiobooks and (2) TV shows. The project uses MVC architecture and it's embedded in a TabBar to facilitate the selection of each media type.

**Future work:**
I would have liked to include more media type options, as well as provide a more aesthetic design. I also would have liked to include code coverage by implementing unit tests. 

### Requirements
The project was developed and tested using:
* Xcode Version 10.2
* Swift 5.0

### Installation
1. Download the project.
3. Open the `iTunesMediaApp.xcodeproj` with Xcode and hit run.
